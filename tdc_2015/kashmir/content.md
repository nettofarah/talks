# Rails doesn't Scale

Said someone in the Past.
For whatever reason.

Assuming everything is in place

front-end only

---

# With a lot of Processes
Not that hard

---

could be tricky

## Cache Invalidation
and
## Naming Things

---
class: fake-middle
# Ok, so you're still not convinced

---
class: fake-middle
# The `Rails.cache` route

---
class: fake-middle
# Ops, we forgot to remove it from the cache

---
class: fake-middle
# Just ask her to clear the browser cache

---
class: fake-middle
# Oh, that number is off because of our cache

---
class: fake-middle
# No worries, our cache should be clear in about 4 hours

---
class: fake-middle
# Oh shoot! I forgot to add the line that removes it from the cache

---
class: fake-middle
# And Some other design problems like

---
class: fake-middle
# Cache Invalidation in callback hooks

---
class: fake-middle
# Inconsistent TTLs

---
class: fake-middle
# Inconsistent Cache Keys

---
class: fake-middle
# Nested Caching

---
class: fake-middle
# N+1 Queries
from cache

---
class: fake-middle
# Unrealistic Experience

---
class: fake-middle
# What happens if your cache box dies?

---
class: fake-middle
# I'm not saying you should abandon caching altogether
But maybe there is a better way

---
class: fake-middle
# What if I told you
That some times looking up `memcached` could be slower than performing a lookup in your database

---
class: fake-middle
# Step 0

## Understand your bottlenecks

---
class: fake-middle
# Most performance challenges are IO bound

---
class: fake-middle
# That might not be true sometimes, though

---
class: fake-middle
# Step 1

Understand your Database.

---
class: fake-middle
# Step 1
## Understand your Database

---
class: fake-middle
# `EXPLAIN` and `SLOW LOG` are your best friends

---
class: fake-middle
# Spend some time analyzing your indexes
specially compound ones

---
class: fake-middle
# Search Engines (SOLR, ElasticSearch)

Try and understand how indexes are constructed. When commit operations are performed,
`analyze` your indexes at write and read time.

---
class: fake-middle
# Redis

`SLOWLOG` can save you

---
class: fake-middle
# Step 2
## Use the best tool for the job

---
class: fake-middle
# Is your data composed by relationships?
Use SQL

---
class: fake-middle
# Key value?
You can use Redis for that

---
class: fake-middle
# Performing a Search?
ElasticSearch and SOLR might be just fast enough for you

---
class: fake-middle
# Still not convinced?

---
class: fake-middle
# How to Cache?

---
class: fake-middle
# HTTP Caching
My favorite kind. If used wisely.

- Headers
- Varnish / Instart Logic

---
class: fake-middle
# Template Caching
IMO, Doesn't sound like a great practice.

---
class: fake-middle
# Controller Caching
Very tricky and when it comes to state.

---
class: fake-middle
# Model Caching
Hard to design

---
class: fake-middle
# Russian Doll Caching
Sounds very promising. But you'd have to do some upfront work.
